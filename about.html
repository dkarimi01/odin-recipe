    <p>
      The reason I have made this website is to practise my skill with the help
      the Odin Project and while thinking of what recipes to use I have tried to
      make a list of what meals are good for the gym.
    </p>
    <p>
      I will use this opportunity to make a list of delicious meals I enjoy
      which are also have good macros for you to help you gain as much muscle
      without eating lots of fatty food
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite this being a website made to learn, If anyone stumbles upon it I
      hope I inspire you to make one of the meals I have set here
