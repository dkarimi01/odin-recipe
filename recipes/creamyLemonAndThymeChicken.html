    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Tender, golden-seared chicken breasts simmered in a luxuriously creamy
      sauce infused with fresh thyme, zesty lemon, and a hint of garlic. Each
      bite balances the brightness of citrus with the comforting richness of
      cream, creating a dish that’s both elegant and heartwarming. Perfectly
      paired with mashed potatoes, rice, or buttery noodles, this dish delivers
      a burst of fresh flavor in every mouthful.

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <uo>
      <li>2 tsp. fresh thyme</li>
      <li>2 tsp. mixed herbs</li>
      <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
      <li>6 boneless, skinless chicken thighs</li>
      <li>1 tbsp. oil</li>
      <li>1 onion <em>chopped</em></li>
      <li>2 garlic cloves <em>chopped</em></li>
      <li>Juice of 1 lemon</li>
      <li>100ml chicken stock</li>
      <li>200ml crème fraiche</li>
      <li>Lemon slices</li>
      <li>Fresh thyme</li>
    </uo>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        First, prepare the seasoning by mixing the fresh thyme, mixed herbs,
        salt, and pepper in a little bowl. Sprinkle generously over your chicken
        thighs, making sure to coat evenly, and keep any remaining seasoning to
        the side to use later.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, add the oil to a large pan over a medium heat. Once hot, add your
        chicken thighs and cook for several minutes on each side. They should be
        crispy and browned on the outside, and completely cooked through on the
        inside (with no pink bits). Remove the chicken from the pan and set
        aside.
      </li>
      <li>
        In the same pan as you cooked the chicken, add the onion and garlic and
        cook for a few minutes until softened. Then add the lemon juice, chicken
        stock, and any of the remaining seasoning mix, stir well to combine, and
        allow to bubble for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the crème fraiche, stir through, and cook for another 2-3 minutes to
        thicken. Then add the chicken thighs back into the pan and allow to heat
        up for a few minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Remove from the heat and garnish with fresh lemon slices and a sprinkle
        of thyme. Serve up with quinoa and enjoy immediately or portion up for
        your meal prep for the week. Delicious.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Tips</h2>
    <p>
      Boneless chicken thighs work just as well as breasts and stay extra juicy.
      For an added burst of flavor, stir a handful of baby spinach or a few
      sun-dried tomatoes into the sauce before serving.
