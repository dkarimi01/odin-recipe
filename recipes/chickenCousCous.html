    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Chicken couscous is a versatile dish that combines spiced chicken and
      vegetables with light, fluffy couscous, often a quick-cooking pasta made
      from durum wheat.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <uo>
      <li>1 tbsp. curry paste</li>
      <li>1 tbsp. mango chutney</li>
      <li>½ tsp. turmeric</li>
      <li>Salt to taste</li>
      <li>50ml olive oil</li>
      <li>4 chicken breast</li>
      <li>300g couscous</li>
      <li>350ml vegetable stock</li>
    </uo>
    <h2>Method</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Firstly, make a marinade for your chicken by adding the curry paste,
        chutney, turmeric, salt and olive oil to a bowl and mixing well.
      </li>
      <li>
        Then, cut each chicken breast in half and add to the marinade, stirring
        until well covered, and then leave aside for at least 20 minutes —
        ideally in the fridge overnight.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, heat a grill pan over medium heat and lay out your chicken pieces.
        Grill for 5-6 minutes on each side, or until golden and slightly
        charred.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, place the couscous in a big bowl and carefully pour in the
        boiling vegetable stock. Cover the bowl with a lid and leave to soak for
        around 5 minutes, then fluff your couscous with a fork and add any
        extras you want — pomegranate seeds are great for a flash of colour and
        burst of flavour.
      </li>
      <li>
        Finally, divide your couscous into 4 containers, top with two pieces of
        marinated chicken and finish with a sprinkle of coriander.
      </li>
